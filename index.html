                <h3>About Me as a Reader</h3>
                <p>
                  Reading has always been a way for me to understand the world
                  beyond my own experience. Before taking Great Books, I
                  approached literature mainly for enjoyment, but this course
                  pushed me to read with greater intention and curiosity. I
                  became more aware of how stories reveal truths about people,
                  society, and the struggles that shape human history. What drew
                  me to Great Books was the opportunity to explore classic works
                  that continue to influence culture and thought. Through this
                  course, I hoped to deepen my understanding of different
                  perspectives, strengthen my ability to analyze texts
                  critically and discover how literature can challenge my
                  assumptions. As a reader, I have learned to appreciate not
                  just what a story tells, but how and why it tells it.

                <p>
                  The Great Books course is an exploration of literature that
                  has shaped human thought and culture across time. Through
                  careful reading and critical analysis, we examine timeless
                  works that continue to resonate with contemporary readers,
                  uncovering universal themes and diverse perspectives on the
                  human experience.

                <p>
                  This website serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my
                  literary analyses throughout the semester. It showcases my
                  critical thinking, interpretive skills and ability to engage
                  with complex texts through various analytical frameworks. Each
                  analysis demonstrates my evolving understanding of literature
                  and its profound connections to human experience.

            <p>
              In this story, a pair of crows build a nest and lay eggs, but a
              snake living at the bottom of the tree keeps climbing up to eat
              them. No matter how hard the crows try to protect their eggs, the
              snake always returns. Feeling helpless, the crows ask a wise
              jackal for help. The jackal advises them to use a clever plan
              instead of fighting. The crow then steals a necklace from the
              queen’s palace and drops it into the snake’s hole. When the palace
              guards find the necklace there, they dig up the hole and kill the
              snake. After that, the crows can raise their young safely.

          <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Archetypal Elements in the Story</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Snake as the Villain - The snake represents danger, fear and
                destruction. Like many villains in stories, it threatens the
                lives of the innocent and creates constant harm.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Crow as the Hero - Even though the crow is not powerful, it
                is determined to protect its family. This makes the crow a
                “hero” figure someone who refuses to give up despite suffering
                losses.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Jackal as the Wise Helper - The jackal plays the role of the
                guide or mentor. He gives the crows the advice they need when
                they feel lost and hopeless.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleverness as the Winning Strategy - Instead of fighting
                strength with strength, the crows use a trick to defeat the
                snake. This is a common pattern in many stories where brains win
                over brute force.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Using the archetypal lens makes the story feel connected to many
              other tales across cultures. We recognize the snake, the hero and
              the helper because these character types appear in stories all
              over the world. Seeing these patterns helps us understand why the
              story is memorable: it teaches a simple but strong lesson about
              overcoming challenges using clever thinking rather than force.

            <p>
              Psyche is a princess so beautiful that people begin to praise her
              more than the goddess of beauty, stirring the goddess’ jealousy.
              Venus orders her son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a
              monster but Cupid instead falls deeply in love with her. Psyche is
              taken (by invisible forces) to a magical palace, where she lives
              with her mysterious husband whom she is forbidden to see. Though
              treated with kindness and luxury, Psyche becomes restless and
              persuaded by her jealous sisters secretly looks at him with a
              lamp, learning her husband is Cupid. Startled, she accidentally
              wounds him; he flees. Psyche is heartbroken and wanders the earth
              searching for him. To win him back, she must face a series of
              difficult tasks imposed by Venus. With help from nature and divine
              intervention, Psyche completes each task. In the end, Cupid brings
              Psyche before the gods and she is granted immortality they marry
              and Psyche becomes divine.

            <h2>Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Key archetypal and symbolic elements</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Psyche as the Soul - The name “Psyche” literally means “soul.”
                Her journey from mortal perfection, to loss, to exile, to trials
                and finally divine union mirrors the soul’s path toward
                enlightenment or spiritual maturation
              </li>
              <li>
                Cupid (Love) as Spiritual Guide - Cupid’s love for Psyche
                reflects “divine love” or a higher guiding force that draws the
                soul toward growth and immortality. Their forbidden marriage,
                hidden at first, represents the mysterious, inner connection
                between love and soul beyond physical appearance or societal
                expectations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trials as Initiation / Purification - The tasks imposed by Venus
                represent stages of purification, testing Psyche’s faith,
                patience, humility qualities often associated with spiritual or
                psychological growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transition from Mortal to Divine - Psyche’s rise from vulnerable
                mortal to immortal goddess symbolizes transformation and
                transcendence a common motif in myths through suffering and
                endurance, the soul becomes something greater.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Cupid and Psyche as an allegory for the soul’s journey goes beyond
              its surface as a romantic myth. It becomes a story about human
              inner life, love, doubt, suffering, growth and eventual
              transcendence. It shows that love when rooted in trust and faith
              can lead to personal transformation. The trials represent inner
              psychological or spiritual tests rather than mere plot devices.

              The story of Kulakog and Tilmag tells about two creatures living

              behaviors. Tilmag is hardworking and resourceful, while Kulakog is
              lazy and relies on others. One day, their differences become
              clear: Tilmag works diligently to gather food and prepare for the
              future, while Kulakog takes advantage of her. In the end, Kulakog
              suffers the consequences of laziness, showing that effort and
              diligence are rewarded while idleness leads to failure.

              </li>
              <li>
                Tilmag as the Trickster / Dependent - Symbolizes laziness and
                exploitation, taking advantage of others’ work instead of
                contributing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conflict Between Effort and Idleness - The struggle between the
                two characters symbolizes broader social tensions between
                productive and non-productive members of society.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consequences as Moral Symbol - Tilmag’s suffering represents
                justice and the principle that one must work to reap rewards.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The story reflects real life social dynamics where hard work is
              sometimes taken for granted and inequality arises when some
              benefit without contributing. Through this lens, Kulakog and
              Tilmag is not only a moral tale about diligence but also a
              reflection on society, fairness and the dignity of labor.

              Morella tells the story of a man who marries a highly intelligent
              and deeply philosophical woman named Morella. She studies
              metaphysics and explores the mysteries of life, death and
              identity. Morella becomes gravely ill and dies, but before her
              death, she expresses ideas about the immortality of the soul and
              reincarnation. After her death, the narrator and his new wife have
              a daughter. Shockingly, the child grows to resemble Morella in
              appearance and behavior. Eventually, the daughter herself dies and
              the narrator realizes that she is the reincarnation of Morella,
              highlighting the story’s themes of obsession, identity and the
              inescapable nature of the past.

              a sense of suspense, horror and fascination by allowing readers to
              explore fear, grief and obsession through the narrator’s
              perspective.

            <p>
              A Rose for Emily tells the story of Emily Grierson, a reclusive
              Southern woman who lives in a decaying mansion in her hometown.
              After her father’s death, Emily isolates herself from society. She
              briefly becomes involved with a man named Homer Barron, but the
              relationship is shrouded in mystery. Emily refuses to acknowledge
              the passage of time, clinging to the past and resisting social
              change. After her death, townspeople discover Homer’s corpse in
              her house, revealing that Emily had been sleeping beside it for
              years. The story explores themes of isolation, obsession, decay
              and the effects of a controlling upbringing.

              <li>
                The House - Symbolizes Emily’s mind and the stagnation of her

              <li>

            <p>
              Using a Psychoanalytic lens, the story can be interpreted as an
              exploration of Emily’s unconscious mind, repression and unresolved
              conflicts. My main argument is that Emily’s behavior is driven by
              a combination of childhood trauma, fear of abandonment and an
              inability to reconcile reality with her desires.

            <p>
              Psalm 23 expresses trust in God as a shepherd who guides,
              protects, and provides for the believer. The psalmist describes
              walking “through the valley of the shadow of death” without fear,
              emphasizing divine care, guidance and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Job 38 is part of s God’s response to Job after his suffering. God
              questions Job, highlighting the vastness of creation, natural
              order and human limitations. Through rhetorical questions about
              the universe, weather and animals, God emphasizes divine power,
              wisdom and the limits of human understanding.

              A formalist reading highlights how literary devices—structure,

              itself rather than external context, we see how careful
              composition creates spiritual and emotional impact, making the
              messages of guidance, trust and humility universally powerful and
              enduring.

            <h2>Collective Insights on Human Experience</h2>
            <p>
              Across the six texts I analyzed, one of the strongest insights
              about human experience is the constant tension between personal
              desires and the forces that shape our lives. Whether the stories
              focus on love, loss, identity or inner conflict, each narrative
              reveals how individuals struggle to understand themselves while
              navigating the world’s uncertainties. Many of the characters
              confront situations that challenge their values, push them toward
              transformation or force them to face uncomfortable truths about
              themselves. Themes such as resilience, powerlessness, moral choice
              and emotional vulnerability appear repeatedly, showing that human
              experience is rarely simple. Instead, it is shaped by layers of
              internal and external pressures that influence how we act, what we
              believe and who we become.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
            <p>
              Collectively, the texts also highlight how society and culture
              deeply influence human behavior. Through different settings and
              historical contexts, the stories reveal the power of social
              expectations, class structures, traditions and institutions in
              shaping people’s opportunities and limitations. Many of the works
              expose inequalities between genders, social classes or cultural
              groups showing how certain individuals benefit from privilege
              while others struggle against systemic barriers. At the same time,
              the texts critique the norms that societies often treat as natural
              or unquestionable. By presenting characters who challenge, conform
              to, or suffer under these norms, the stories offer insight into
              how culture both guides and restricts us. Together, these texts
              demonstrate that literature not only reflects the societies that
              produced it but also encourages readers to question and rethink
              the world they live in.

          <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Major Themes and Patterns</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout the six stories, several themes and narrative patterns
              emerged that created strong connections between the texts. Many of
              the works explore the internal conflicts people experience when
              faced with difficult moral choices, while others reveal how deeply
              individuals are shaped by the societies they live in. Across the
              readings, I noticed recurring symbols and archetypes such as the
              journey, the outsider and moments of transformation that emphasize
              universal struggles shared across different times and cultures.
            </p>

            <div class="themes-grid">
              <div class="theme-card">
                <h3>Theme 1 : The Struggle for Identity</h3>
                <p>
                  A recurring theme across multiple texts is the characters’
                  search for identity. Whether they are questioning their role
                  in society, struggling with inner conflicts or redefining
                  their beliefs, many protagonists face moments where they must
                  confront who they truly are. This theme appears in stories
                  where characters resist external expectations, challenge
                  traditional roles or try to understand their purpose. The
                  texts collectively show that identity is not fixed; it is
                  shaped by personal experiences, relationships and the
                  pressures of the world around us.

                <h3>Theme 2 : Power and Social Inequality</h3>
                <p>
                  Another major theme is the presence of power dynamics and the
                  social inequalities that influence human behavior. Several
                  texts highlight how class, gender and authority structures
                  determine people’s choices and limit their freedom. Characters
                  often find themselves caught between those who hold power and
                  those who are marginalized. These stories reveal how society
                  creates systems that benefit a few while leaving others
                  vulnerable and how individuals either conform to, resist or
                  are broken by these systems.

              </div>
              <div class="theme-card">
                <h3>Theme 3 : Transformation Through Conflict</h3>
                <p>
                  Many of the stories also emphasize how conflict whether
                  internal, interpersonal or societal drives transformation.
                  Characters often face situations that force them to change,
                  adapt or see the world differently. These conflicts lead to
                  realizations about justice, responsibility, truth or human
                  nature. Across the texts, transformation appears not as a
                  single moment but as a gradual process shaped by struggle,
                  reflection, and resilience.

            <h2>Key Realizations</h2>
            <p>
              Studying these texts together helped me see how literature reveals
              patterns of human behavior that repeat across different periods
              and cultures. One of my most important realizations is that even
              though the stories come from diverse backgrounds, they address
              universal questions about identity, power and morality. I was
              surprised by how deeply societal structures influence personal
              choices and how characters often fight silent battles shaped by
              expectations they cannot escape. This challenged my earlier
              assumption that literature is mainly about individual stories, now
              I understand that each narrative also reflects bigger social
              forces. I also gained a new perspective on how conflict can act as
              a catalyst for growth, showing that transformation often comes
              from discomfort rather than certainty. Overall, reading these
              works together strengthened my awareness of the complexities of
              human experience and the many factors that shape who we become.

            <h2>Evolution of My Literary Understanding</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout this Great Books course, my way of reading stories has
              changed a lot. At first, I focused mostly on what happened in the
              story. Over time, I learned to look deeper, thinking about
              characters, symbols, themes and the lessons behind the story. The
              different critical lenses helped me see that every story has many
              layers and can be understood in several ways. I also learned to be
              an active reader — someone who asks questions, reflects and thinks
              about what the story means, instead of just reading for fun. I
              became better at noticing details, interpreting meaning and
              connecting stories to life, society and human nature.

            <h2>The Critical Lenses: Challenges and Insights</h2>

            <h3>Most Challenging Lens</h3>
            <p>
              The Psychoanalytic lens was the hardest for me. It required me to
              think about the characters’ unconscious feelings and motivations,
              like fears or desires they might not understand themselves. At
              first, it was confusing to connect these ideas to the story
              events. By rereading stories like A Rose for Emily and focusing on
              clear examples of obsession or fear, I learned how to apply this
              lens. It taught me to notice the inner struggles of characters and
              understand their actions more deeply.
            </p>

            <h3>Most Insightful Lens</h3>
            <p>
              The Reader-Response lens was the most useful for me. It showed
              that reading is not just about the story itself, but also about
              how I react to it. While reading Morella, my feelings of fear and
              curiosity shaped my understanding. This lens taught me to pay
              attention to my own reactions and realize that different readers
              may interpret the same story in different ways. I will continue
              using this approach in future reading.

            <h2>Impact on Thinking, Values and Worldview</h2>
            <p>
              Reading these Great Books helped me think about life, society and
              human nature in new ways. Stories like Cupid and Psyche and The
              Crow and the Snake made me reflect on love, intelligence and
              morality. I also learned more about fairness, resilience and
              spiritual growth from texts like Psalm 23 and Job 38. These
              stories made me more thoughtful, empathetic and aware of human
              struggles. I now see literature as a tool to understand people,
              society and myself better.

            <p>
              This course was an important learning experience. It helped me
              think critically and reflect on stories in deeper ways. Using the
              lenses and reading different types of texts showed me that stories
              are more than entertainment — they teach lessons about life, human
              nature, and society. I will take these skills and insights with
              me, not just in school but in how I read, think and understand the
              world in the future.
